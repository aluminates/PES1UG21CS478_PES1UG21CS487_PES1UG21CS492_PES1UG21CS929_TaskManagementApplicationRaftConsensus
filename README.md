# A Task Management Application using Raft Consensus Algorithm and MySQL
The objective of this project is to develop a task management application that utilises the Raft consensus algorithm to ensure consistency and fault tolerance across multiple nodes. MySQL will be employed as the backend database to store task data. The application will enable users to create, update, delete, and manage tasks across the distributed system.
