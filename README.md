# A Task Management Application using Raft Consensus Algorithm and MySQL
The objective of this project is to develop a task management application that utilises the Raft Consensus Algorithm to ensure consistency and fault tolerance across multiple nodes. MySQL is employed as the backend database to store task data. The application enables users to create, update, delete, and manage tasks across the distributed system.
